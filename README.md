## Sitemap

This sitemap was made in prior to give me a general idea of where I was heading in site navigations. Basing my Wireframes and Design choices off of these gives me a better general idea.

## Design

Choosing a colour palette was relatively easy, and wasn't bothered much throughout the process. I wanted a simple, clear, earthy naturaly tone colour scheme that gave the audience an ease of access.

### Font

Using Google fonts I integrated it into CSS.
This font design provides a simplistic look, yet 'fun' and engaging.

### Colour Palette

Using Colors.co to, browsing and choosing based off my 'Ah that's the one' feeling.
Ideally prioritising the modern look, but desiring for an engaging audience effect.

## Target Audience

At the current stage and circumstances, my portfolio was primarily for hiring managers and recruiters, although due to the lack of time, I had not had enough time to properly publish its final touches and finishing up bits and pieces accustomed for those who are seeking for entry-level web developers. As this was done in a day.

Those on the table looking for fast-workers at efficient level, I would humbly like to say I quite suit the criteria XD.
